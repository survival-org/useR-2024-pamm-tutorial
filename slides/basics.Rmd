# `pammtools` tackles survival problems

We are interested in:

-   time span,
-   survival time,
-   duration,
-   transition probability

End of the time span defined by occurence of an **event**.

A random variable $T \geq 0$ defining the length of the time span is observed.

We want to characterize/estimate the distribution of event times $T$, potentially depending on covariates (under censoring)

# `pammtools` facilitates the pre- and post-processing for survival analyses.

TODAY: focus on pre- and post-processing, and estimating hazards using `mgcv::gam` 

BUT: PEM based approaches are not limited to statistical models (cf. `r Citet(bib, "bender.generalMl.2021")`)

# Using `mgcv::gam` for estimation has many adavantages

- Model flexibly, especially complex predictor structures
- Include mixed effects easily
- Yield smooth effects prone towards over-fitting
