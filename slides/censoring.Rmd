# Censoring

In many studies:

- patients are still alive at the end of the study period,
- patients are still sick at the end of the study,
- the status of patients is unknown after some time (moved away, switched doctor, ...).

$\implies$  Instead of observing $T$, we only know that $T>c$, where $c$ is the end of our observation period. <br>
$\implies$ **Right-censoring**

# Censoring: other types

**Interval-censoring**:
The event is known to have occurred in a specific time interval, but the exact time within the interval is unknown.
- Example: An examination is carried out every year. The patient showed up in year 1 and again in year 4. The event was observed to have occured in year 4, but it is unknown when exactly between year 1 and year 4.

**Left-censoring**:
The event is known to have occurred earlier than a certain time point, however
there is no information about how much earlier.
- Example: Same setting as above, but the patient was examined for the first time in year 4.

# Censoring vs. Truncation

It is important to distinguish between **censoring** and **truncation**

**Censoring**:
Observation unit is included in the study, but the exact time of the event of interest is unknown.

**Truncation**:
Observation unit is included in the study *conditional* on an event (not) occurring before or after a time point.

- truncation is a form of sampling bias
- Examples:
  + Data regarding the reporting delay (time between symptom onset and reporting of a new case) in the context of COVID-19  is right-truncated: On any given day, cases with long reporting delay are not yet included
  + Lifetimes of inhabitants of retirement homes are left-truncated, as one has to survive until retirement age in order to be eligible for retirement housing
