# Event History Analysis: Left-Truncation becomes relevant

- So far we only considered transitions from the initial status (e.g., alive) to a single event of interest (e.g., death)
- However, methods for Lifetime Data Analysis can also be applied to settings with
multiple states and transitions between them
- This more general setting is often refered to as *Event History Analysis*

- Left-truncation can occur in each of the "0" states
- In addition, left truncation is relevant for each (secondary) transition in a multi-state model (MSM), e.g.,
  + When estimating the hazard for transition "1 $\rightarrow$ 2", subjects arrive in state "1" at different time points
  + Similarly, for transitions "2 $\ra$ 1" and "2 $\ra$ 3"
  + State "3" is a competing risk w.r.t. state "1"

# Event History Analysis: Even with Left-truncation, PAMMs work as before

- Data transformation:
  + as usual with `as_ped`, but specify left-truncation time and event time in formula
  + in each interval, only subjects that were at risks at that time
- Modell fit:
  + as usual based on properly transformed data
  + hazard can be estimated unbiasedly (assuming left-truncation time and event time are independent)
