# Event History Analysis

- So far we only considered transitions from the initial status (e.g., alive) to a single event of interest (e.g., death)
- However, methods for Lifetime Data Analysis can also be applied to settings with
multiple states and transitions between them
- This more general setting is often refered to as *Event History Analysis*
