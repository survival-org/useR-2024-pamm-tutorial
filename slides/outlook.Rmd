# **`pammtools`**: Hazard, Density and Survival ... important utility functions are implemented

*Pre-Processing*:

- `as_ped(data, formula, cut, ...)` creates PED-formatted data suitable for PAMMs.
Also merges additional datasets for time-dependent covariates according to the specification in `formula` and handles left-truncation.

*Post-Processing*:

- `make_newdata(x, <optional covariate specifications>)` creates PED-formatted data suitable for evaluating PAMM estimates for all intervals using `add_???`-functions.
  Covariates are set to their sample means or modes by default.
- `add_???(newdata, object)` computes PAMM point estimates (and CIs) from a model `object` on `newdata` and appends them to `newdata`.  Resulting `data.frame` useful for custom visualizations etc.
   Flavors: `add_surv_prob`, `add_hazard`, `add_cumu_hazard`, `add_cif`, `add_term`, `add_trans_prob`
- `tidy_fixed()`, `tidy_re()`, `tidy_smooth()` extract estimated coefficients / smooth effects and CIs as clean `data.frames`
- `gg_fixed()`, `gg_smooth()`, `gg_slice()`, ... etc for direct `ggplot2` viz of estimates

# Exposure-Lag-Response Associations

Much more generally, PAMMs/**pammtools** can also be used to fit delayed and time-limited, cumulative and time-varying effects of TDCs


We refer to these types of effects as *E*xposure-*L*ag *R*esponse *A*ssociations (ELRA). See `r Citet(bib, "bender_penalized_2019")` for details

# Beyond (mgcv) GAMMs

Here we focused on GAMMs as backend for computation (which makes sense!), however, in some situation another backend might be advantageous, e.g.

- **`scam`**: GAMMs with monotonicity constraints
- **`brms`**: Fully Bayesian estimation of (hierarchical) GAMMs
- **`mboost`**: Boosting GAMMs for automated variable/term selection
- ...

Most of the functionality of **`pammtools`**, especially data trafo can be used as before

Some adjustments w.r.t. to post-processing might be necessary

# Beyond Statistical Modeling

In general, PEM based approaches not limited to statistical modeling (cf. `r Citet(bib, "bender.generalMl.2021")`)
