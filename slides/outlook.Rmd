# `pbc`, `veterans`, `sir.adm`, `prothr`... what's the point?

Summarizing, after many examples, we have seen that `pammtools`...
- ...can deal with time-dependent covariates
- ...can deal with time-varying effects
- ...can deal with left truncation
- ...can combine the above flexibility and can deal with event-history data, especially multi-state settings with recurrent events.

However, that is not all... Many more examples can be found here [adibender.github.io/pammtools](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/)

# Exposure-Lag-Response Associations

Much more generally, PAMMs/**pammtools** can also be used to fit delayed and time-limited, cumulative and time-varying effects of TDCs


We refer to these types of effects as *E*xposure-*L*ag *R*esponse *A*ssociations (ELRA). See `r Citet(bib, "bender_penalized_2019")` for details

# Beyond (mgcv) GAMMs

Here we focused on GAMMs as backend for computation (which makes sense!), however, in some situation another backend might be advantageous, e.g.

- **`scam`**: GAMMs with monotonicity constraints
- **`brms`**: Fully Bayesian estimation of (hierarchical) GAMMs
- **`mboost`**: Boosting GAMMs for automated variable/term selection
- ...

Most of the functionality of **`pammtools`**, especially data trafo can be used as before

Some adjustments w.r.t. to post-processing might be necessary

# Beyond Statistical Modeling

In general, PEM based approaches not limited to statistical modeling (cf. `r Citet(bib, "bender.generalMl.2021")`)

# Beyond Statistical Modeling
For example gradient boosted trees (no adjustment to **`xgboost`** needed, only data trafo)

# Deep Statistical Modeling

DeepPAMM `r Citep(bib, c("kopper_semistructured_2021", "kopper.deeppamm.2022"))`: NN-based extension of PAMMs based on *Semi-structured Distributional Regression* framework by David RÃ¼gamer

$$
    h(t|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}_1, ...) = f(\mathbf{x}, t) + \gamma_1 d_1(\mathbf{z}_1) + \dots + \gamma_G d_G(\mathbf{z}_G),
$$

where $f(\mathbf{x}, t)$ is our standard (structured) PAMM predictor and
$d_1(\mathbf{z}_1),  ...$ are embedings learned from (deep) neural networks

Allows to specify standard survival model depending on tabular features (with stratified baseline hazards, TVE, etc.) + incorporate information from other modalities like image, text, etc.

# The Future of PAMMs/pammtools

- currently working on further functionalities in the multi-state setting, like confidence intervals for transition probabilities

- in the future: refactor backend for more seemless integration of other GAMM software (**`brms`**, **`mboost`**, etc. )

- lots of "under the hood work"

- contributions are welcome!
