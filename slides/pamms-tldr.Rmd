# TL;DR

- several survival tasks can be transformed to standard regression tasks

- this is done via data transformation (and mild assumptions, e.g. piece-wise constant hazard)

- exact data transformation depends on the survival task (right-censoring, left-truncation, recurrent events, ...)

- once data is transformed, we estimate the hazard in each interval, conditional on covariates
- in this setting
  + *time* is a covariate, the baseline hazard is a function of time
  + time-varying effects are interactions of other covariates with time
  + stratified baseline hazards are interactions of time with categorical variables

- any method that can optimize Poisson likelihood with offset can be used for estimation

- GAMMs particularly suitable, especially modelling baseline hazard + time-related effects with splines

# TL;DR (2)

R package **`pammtools`** greatly facilitates work with PEMs/PAMMs, as it abtracts away all the fidly handling of data transformation and prediction
